# World Caf√© Operations Analysis

Conducted exploratory analysis and data cleansing to understand menu items are doing well/not well and what the top customers seem to like the best, which is very important to understand before starting marketing campaigns to increase sales. Used SQL to summarize trends; discovered that the dishes with the highest purchase potential are dishes from the Italian category. Created a report with an insights and recommendations section so that the restaurant can make better use of marketing and sales campaigns, and also boost sales in other categories.

In the files you will find the project report in PDF with all the data extracted transcribed (also used storytelling), an SQL file with all the research carried out and also the databases.

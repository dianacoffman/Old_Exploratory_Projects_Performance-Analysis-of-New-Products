## Insightsüí°

- Italian Food Category Leads Sales: The Italian food category is currently our top performer, generating the highest sales among all menu categories. This suggests strong customer preference and demand.
- Decline in Mexican Dishes: Orders for Mexican dishes are noticeably lower compared to other categories, indicating a potential shift in customer preferences or dissatisfaction.
- Order Volume Overview: We observe an average of approximately 60 sales per day over the three-month period from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023. This provides a baseline for our daily sales performance.
- Top and Bottom Sellers: The Hamburger, from the American category, is the most frequently ordered item with 622 orders. In contrast, the Chicken Tacos from the Mexican category are the least ordered, with only 123 orders.

## Recommendations üõ†Ô∏è

- Adjust Pricing Strategy: Given that Italian dishes, which are priced between $14 and $19, are the most popular, we recommend aligning the prices of other menu categories closer to this range. Items like Edamame, currently priced at $5.00, could be priced higher to improve profit margins without significantly affecting customer demand.
- Enhance Marketing Focus: To capitalize on the strong performance of Italian dishes, we should prioritize marketing campaigns that highlight this category. Targeted promotions can drive further engagement and sales within this segment.
- Boost Sales in Underperforming Categories: Implement promotional strategies, such as special discount days for each category, to increase visibility and sales across all menu offerings. If, after six months, categories like Mexican food continue to underperform, consider evaluating the option of removing them from the menu to optimize overall profitability.
